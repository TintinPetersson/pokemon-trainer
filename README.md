!! Do not forget to use "cd ng-pokemon-trainer" before "ng serve" !!

- We created an Angular application that displays pokemon from the PokeAPI. You can then "catch" them and store them in your trainer profile. As the third project at Experis Academy.

## Features include:

- Login function, using "username" without password. Only able to use the app when signed in. Includes user-login validation.

- Responsive and simple user interface.

- Pokémon catalogue page where you can catch pokemon and display more information about a specific Pokémon. Includes a searchbar that updates on each character that you type.

- A trainer page so the user can view their caught pokemon in the same list format as the catalogue. Also includes the search bar.

- Lastly includes a simple logout function which returns the user to the login page.

CSS library used: TailwindCSS.

Enjoy! :)
